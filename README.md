# TpX: drawing tool for TeX

This is the continuation of the TpX project that has been ported 
to the cross-platform Lazarus environment for Windows/Mac/Linux.

TpX is a lightweight, easy-to-use graphical editor for creating drawings and including them 
into LaTeX files in publication-ready form. It can also be used as a stand-alone editor for 
vector graphics. Up to version 1.5 it has been developed by Alexander Tsyplakov.

## Current status

* Linux: usable for testing with the GTK2 backend
* macos: unusable due to a bug with canvas drawing on both carbon and cocoa backend
* Windows: usable for testing with the win32 backend
